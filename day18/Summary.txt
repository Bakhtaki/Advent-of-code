each Number is a pair

a + b = [a, b]
ex: [1, 2] + [3, 4] = [[1,2], [3,4]]

- If any pair is nested inside four pairs, the leftmost such pair explodes.
- If any regular number is 10 or greater, the leftmost such regular number splits.

Explode:
left  element of pair add to left previous pair and right element of  pair add to right previous pair ,current pair replace with 0.


Split:
floor(left element of pair /2) add to left previous pair and ceil(right element of pair /2) add to left next  pair ,current pair replace with 0.


priority with explode then split
