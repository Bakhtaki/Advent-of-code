- the probe x position increases by its x velocity
- the probe y position increases by its y velocity
- for x > 0 probe change -1 and for x < 0 probe change 1
- for gravity, the probe y velocity decreases by 1


x += x Velocity
y += y Velocity
x Velocity =- 1 (until x = 0)
y Velocity =- 1


- What is the highest y position th`e probe reaches?
-example = (6,9)
-expected output = 45
